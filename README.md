# **Dogs vs Cat Classification**

This repository contains code and files related to the Dogs vs Cat Classification project using Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The project aims to develop a model capable of classifying images as either dogs or cats. Cat and dog classification is a fundamental problem in machine learning involving the use of convolutional neural networks to analyze and recognize visual features in images.

**Goal:**
The main goal of this project is to develop, evaluate, and utilize convolutional neural networks in image classification. The project also aims to:
- Create a robust testing framework to evaluate the performance of the classification model.
- Search for model improvements by adjusting model parameters such as network architecture, learning rate, and activation functions.
- Save and load trained models to quickly and efficiently make predictions on new data.

**Repository Contents:**
1. **Python Code**: Contains Python scripts for training the CNN model, evaluating model performance, and making predictions on test data.
2. **Dataset**: Contains datasets of cat and dog images used for training and testing the model.
3. **Documentation**: Contains documentation or user guides for using the repository and running scripts.
4. **Results**: Contains experiment results, such as model performance metrics and visualization of prediction results.

**Usage:**
1. Download or clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Prepare the dataset by splitting it into training and test data.
3. Run the Python script to train the CNN model using the training data.
4. Evaluate the model's performance using the test data and adjust model parameters if necessary.
5. Save the trained model for future use or prediction on new data.

**Contributing:**
Contributions from the machine learning community are highly appreciated. If you find bugs, want to add new features, or improve model performance, please submit a pull request with your changes.
